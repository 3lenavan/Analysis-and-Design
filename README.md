**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The problem was to design a course planner application that could load course data from a file, allow users to view a list of all courses, and display that information about a specific course (also including its prerequisites). The goal was to create an efficient and user-friendly program that demonstrates understanding of data structures.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand?**

I approached the problem by first identifying reading course data, storing it in a efficient way, and allowing fast lookups and sorting. I chose to use a vector data structure for storing courses because it provides simplicity and fast insertion. Data structures are important because they directly affect how quickly and efficiently data can be accessed and manipulated, impacting the overall performance of software.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

One of the main roadblocks was handling invalid user input and file loading errors gracefully. I overcame this by using input validation techniques like clearing and ignoring invalid input from cin, and checking if the file opened successfully before proceeding. Debugging and small adjustments in reading and parsing the file also helped ensure the data loaded correctly.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project helped expanded my approach by making me more aware of how critical it is to think ahead about user experience and data validation. I also learned the importance of designing modular code by breaking tasks into separate, focused functions. Planning for different cases, like missing files or wrong input, became a bigger part of my development process.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Working on this project taught me to focus more on clear naming conventions, detailed comments, and structured code formatting. Writing maintainable and readable code makes it easier to update. For example, if another data structure like a hash table or binary search tree needs to be added in the future, having clean and modular functions would make it easier to make these changes.
